# v1.0.8
- Support for 11.1.5
- There are now dropdowns for border and border color, yippee!
  - I thank Blizzard for adding the necessary functions to enable this. They didn't need to add new stuff to this 20 year old API, yet they did.
- Borders, border colors, and background are now previewed on the model as you mouse over the options in the dropdowns.
