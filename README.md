## Known Issues

- Due to the limitations of the ancient backend system powering the tabard frames, certain functions aren't possible.
  - Dropdowns for Border and Border color are not possible
  - Emblem previews can't be added to the emblem dropdown
- If you manage to open the frame when you're not at a tabard vendor, your character might get stuck with the tabard texture on them.
  - To fix this, you can either relog or go visit a tabard vendor and toggle the UI.
