# Tabardy

Tabardy is a complete redesign of the in-game Tabard Designer UI for World of Warcraft.

## Quirks

- If you manage to open the frame when you're not at a tabard vendor, your character might get stuck with the tabard texture on them.
  - To fix this, you can either relog or go visit a tabard vendor and toggle the UI. I have no idea why these tabards are so assertive.
